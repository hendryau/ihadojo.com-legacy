What is the connection between skill and attitude? Simply put, people like to train with nice partners. So the more cooperative and useful you are as a partner, the more often you will get a chance to train. And this is the key to learning. Sensei says that \"honest training\" means you don’t try to hurt anyone, but that you train hard enough to know that it works for you. If you get hurt, he said, you just say \"my mistake\" and keep training; no hard feelings or \"get back\" resentments. He said that it is very important to find and to be the right kind of training partner; otherwise you never \"grow up\". So having a generous spirit is the beginning and also the goal of training",

If we always seek our own way, try to win or overpower weaker partners we are confusing the means for the ends. That is, we have an improper perspective on the purpose of karate. The point of partner work is not to be the person who never falls, gets hit or is submitted. The end does not justify the means with our partner work. It is not permissible to do anything in attempts to have our way and it is not the natural order of the universe (the tao or do) that the weak must be dominated by the strong. Through cooperation in partner work we can begin to develop the skills of shinjutsu, the \"heart techniques\" that forge a strong spirit by respecting and aiding those weaker than one's self.  Sensei says he prefers taigishin to shingitai because he emphasizes that karate is about a dojo where everyone comes together through the body (tai) and from there move away from all there personality differences to have a common heart (shin). He says this makes him different from other sensei who emphasize just the body and trying to make everyone the same physically ignoring the heart. He said it is all about kokoro, the heart, and not just the body. He said this is what makes karate a do, a way, or an art. Which is why, he says, the gi is white, like a blank canvas that is ready every time we put it on to become something beautiful and meaningful, through"

If you are walking in the woods and suddenly you notice a spider web a few inches from your face or a frog almost beneath your step and you unthinkingly divert your motion to the side, you are experiencing natural flow. This same feeling of flow should be used with a partner. Nagashi uke is a technique that we practice in order to enter into this feeling of flow. Think of water flowing around a stone in the stream when you receive strong attacks."

Sometimes when we do kata for Iha Sensei he shakes his head and says, \"Not yet. You are still doing karate.\" What can this mean? It means it looks as though we are still \"doing moves\" without natural motion. Shizentai-dachi is the fundamental position because it is natural and relaxed. Our kata and partner work should be the same. When we reach for a drink at dinner we would not describe it as, \"This is the reaching-for-a-drink-technique.\" In the same way, when we do kata and kumite we should not think of it as \"techniques\" that we \"apply\" to partners. It is just movement that we have codified for the ease of analysis and teaching. We should not get trapped in the category any more than we should get stuck in the kamae of kata or kumite. Move as if your life depended upon it, but do not go into \"karate mode\" when you put on your gi. Relax and move with the appropriate alignment adapted to This relaxation is critical to nagare and is often dependent upon mental relaxation, which in turn is related to our breathing (kokyu). Although not always possible, try to keep the same mental state in training that you hold when walking with a friend, petting your dog or washing the dishes."
