<h2>Origins</h2>
<p>Okinawa is the birthplace of karatedo, a cultural treasure and oral tradition that has
spread throughout the world and is practiced by millions. The Beikoku Shidokan story is only
one of the many threads within the diverse and rich living tapestry of traditions encompassed
by Okinawan karatedo. The following history chronicles some of the teachers and events that
played key roles in the development of the Shidokan branch of Okinawan Shorin-ryu.</p>

<h2>The History of Shorin Ryu<br>
<small>Katsuya Miyahira, Chairman, Okinawa Shorin Ryu Karate Association</small></h2>
<p>As martial arts instructor and advisor to the last King of the Ryukyuan Dynasty,
Master Sokun Matsumura, often called "Matsumura the Warrior", was the preeminent 
martial artist of his era. Matsumura Sensei developed and trained many disciples, 
one of whom was Anko Itosu.</p>
   
<p>Anko Itosu (1830 - 1915) incorporated the closed, hidden arts of karate into the
physical education given at schools, and worked for broader, further dissemination
of the arts. His disciples, Gichin Funakoshi, Kenwa Mabuni, and Kanken Toyama carried
the arts to mainland Japan while Kentsu Yabu, Chomo Hanashiro, Chotoku Kyan, Choki Motobu,
Mouden Yabiku, Choshin Chibana, Anbun Tokuda, Choujyo Oshiro and Shinpan Shiroma
disseminated Itosu's teachings throughout Okinawa.</p>
   
<p>Choshin Chibana, to better distinguish the style from other forms of karate, and to 
preserve the tenets that had been passed down from his teacher, Anko Itosu, renamed
the form Okinawa Shorin Ryu. While the basic kata of Okinawa Shorin Ryu is Naihanchi,
Anko Itosu modified the traditional kata and incorporated them into the First Dan,
devised new Second and Third Dan, and amalgamated five new patterns of kata
collectively known as Pinan into the Fukyu kata.</p>
   
<p>Shorin Ryu is a natural flow, devoid of unbalanced stances or unnatural breathing
patterns. It has unique patterns of coiling and of relaxing power, allowing easier
concentration of force and the attainment of speedy actions. To best develop the skills
involved in the art of the single, deadly blow, training is targeted at tightly bound bales
of straw. Nor is the art limited to passive modes of defense: the ability to release an
effective counterattack in defense is a crucial element, summarized as "Offense is an
effective form of Defense."</p>

<p>The All Japan Karate Federation seeks to spread Karate as a sport form. Simply put, this
divergence is vast and serious. Winners in combative sports such as boxing may be seen
wildly rejoicing with the announcement of a win, but this is not acceptable in martial arts
such as sumo, judo or karate. A victor restrains his joy out of consideration for the
vanquished. Such is the difference between sport and a martial art.</p>
   
<p>Today, 25 dojos are registered with the Okinawa Shorin Ryu Association. The many more outside
Okinawa and overseas demonstrate the growing presence of Okinawa Shorin Ryu in the world.</p>
   
<h2>History of Okinawa Karate & Kobudo</h2>

<p>Okinawa is composed of many small islands, each having a beautiful landscape and unique
culture and history. In the 12th century, Okinawa was divided into many regions, each with
its own ruler who built a gusuku (castle) and controlled the neighboring villages. Later, 
these regions unified into three main kingdoms. In 1429, King Sho Hashi united these three
forces, creating the Ryukyu Kingdom. During the 15th and 16th centuries, known as the golden
trading era, the Ryukyus developed into a major trading center between China and other
neighboring countries. However, during this period there was the threat from Japanese pirates
and, for purposes of securing one's own safety abroad, bujutsu (martial arts) was of vital
importance. From this historical background, Okinawa's unique karate (formerly referred to as
"te") and kobudo were originated and perfected. Today's karate and kobudo came to be as a
result of combining the good qualities of the martial arts of China and the other Southeastern
Asian countries with the Okinawa "te" through interchanges.</p>

<p>During the Ryukyu Kingdom period, the Shuri "te" was developed with the Shuri Castle as
its origin. The Naha "te" flourished in the commercial city of Naha, and the Tomari "te" was
developed in the Tomari village area which was located between the previous two regions. Famous
bujins (martial arts experts) originated from each region and their tradition has been passed
on to today. As karate and kobudo were forbidden by the lords, their techniques were kept secret
and very little literature regarding these techniques was written. Their traditions were conveyed
either verbally or by individual instruction.</p>

<p>After Okinawa was officially incorporated as a prefecture of Japan, new laws reduced the need
for secrecy, and the education system of the Meiji era (1896-1912) adopted karate and kobudo as
part of its physical education program. Since then, karate and kobudo have been performed in
public. In the Taisho period (1912-1926) they were introduced to mainland Japan, and in the early
Showa period (1926-1988) they spread overseas.</p>

<p>After World War II (1945), Okinawan karate was divided into four ryuhas - Shorin-ryu, Goju-ryu,
Uechi-ryu, and Matsubayashi-ryu. Currently, there are many ryuha and kaiha changing their styles
and techniques, but the karate and kobudo of each ryuha and kaiha have their own kihon kata (basic
kata) from which the attack and defense techniques are logically derived.</p>

<p>The rigorous training cultivates physical power and a keen mind, thus contributing to the
well-being of the society. Karate and kobudo have greatly influenced education. They can be
enjoyed as sports or used as self-defense arts. The diverse elements and characteristics that
made karate and kobudo popular throughout the world have instilled inspiration in the hearts
of millions of people.</p>
