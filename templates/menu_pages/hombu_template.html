<h2>Try a class</h2>
<p>Try a complimentary class! New students are welcome to join at
any time. Both youth and adult classes are available. The study of
karate-do can become a long-term personal investment, so it is
recommended that you observe or participate in a class, talk with
the instructors, and then decide if the dojo and style are right 
for you. Call (517) 482-3217 or email <a href="mailto:mail@ihadojo.com"></a>
