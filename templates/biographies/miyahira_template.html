<h2>Katsuya Miyahira<br><small>1918-2010 </small></h2>

<h3>Many Years Have Passed Since Starting to Learn the Way of Karate</h3>

<p>In 1989, Master Katsuya Miyahira, the president of the Okinawa
	Shorin Ryu Shido-kan, was honored by the Japan Martial Arts Association
	as a person who has contributed distinguished services to the martial
	arts. To commemorate this occasion, I would like to write about Master
	Miyahira's martial arts career from it's beginning. Master Miyahira was
	born in Nishihara, one of the villages directly controlled by the
	King's court, where martial arts had always been popular among the
	residents. He first learned martial arts from his father who had
	graduated from the Toyama Army School and was good at swordplay and
	gymnastics. Entering the First Junior High School, Master Miyahira
	began focussing on karate.</p>

<p>He became a student at the dojo of Choshin Chibana Sensei, which
	was located at Nakijin Goten of Yoshitsugu Teishi; there he received
	influences from the dojo's senior pupils, such as Kangi Shoya,
	Yasuyoshi Kamikosu, Tsuguyoshi Miyagi, Chozo Nakama and Shinji Tawada.
	I have heard that Master Miyahira also learned karate at the First
	Junior High with Anbun Tokuda Sensei and his teacher who taught him the
	spirit of martial arts that has kindness among rigor. Both Chibana
	Sensei and Tokuda Sensei were among the best students of Anko Itosu
	Sensei, the master of the Shuri style (Shuri-te). This situation
	enabled Master Miyahira to learn the traditional katas of the Shuri-te
	both at the town dojo and at school.</p>

<p>Traditional Shuri-te focuses on Atemi. The central idea is that
	blocking (uke) means not only to defend oneself against an attack by
	his opponent, but also to simultaneously crush the attack.
	Idealistically, one should train the hands and feet so as to achieve
	the condition in which strength and flexibility coexist, just as steel
	has both hardness and springiness in it. Thus, using a punching board
	(makiwara), one should hit it more than two hundred times a day with
	each hand, mixing several kinds of punching (tsuki) methods, aiming at
	simultaneous occurrence of offense and defense.</p>

<p>Master Miyahira trained himself, closely following the Shuri-te's
	traditional methods. In 1948, soon after the end of the World War II,
	he opened a karate dojo in his hometown of Nishihara, intending to
	train the youth to be strong persons who could live through any
	difficulties. Master Miyahira set his dojo's rules as follows:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Try to perfect one's own personality</li>
	<li>Cultivate the spirit of making constant efforts</li>
	<li>Admonish one's own youthful ardor</li>
	<li>Value good manors</li>
</ul>

<p>Based on these rules, he created his basic concepts of karate:
	"Following the reason and the law" and "coexisting and co-flourishing".
	He named his dojo Shidokan, hoping to instruct the youth who aspired to
	learn the way of karate. After moving to Naha City in September, 1952,
	he continued his effort to popularize the Shuri-te, and also visited
	the Philippines to teach and propagate karate there. In June, 1974,
	Master Miyahira participated in the First Karate World Championship and
	received an award for his distinguished service in karate.</p>

<p>During the same period, Master Miyahira took office as the
	president of the Okinawa Shorin Ryu Karate Association and strived to
	make the association grow. Invited by the Brazil Shorin Ryu Karate
	Association, the Argentina Shorin Ryu Karate Association, and the North
	America Shorin Ryu Shidokan, he energetically visited these places to
	teach and popularize karate overseas. In 1982, he became a councilor of
	the Japan Karate Federation and devoted his energies to help make
	Japanese karate grow. He also took part in the Japan-China
	International Martial Arts Tournament as the leader of the Japanese
	team, making an effort for the goodwill exchange. In the karate
	division at the 42nd National Athletic Meet in 1987, the Okinawa team
	led by Master Miyahira, finished first overall, the victory earning
	Master Miyahira a special award for his distinguished service by the
	Okinawa Amateur Sports Association. Then came this year's award for
	distinguished services in martial arts.</p>

<p>For the past several decades, I have been inspired by Master
	Miyahira's persistent effort to attain the higher ground in karate and
	in karate only, wishing to some day surpass him. It seems, however,
	that every moment I feel as if I can catch up with him, he is already
	gone far ahead of me; it is like building a ladder to reach the sky. I
	wonder if Master Miyahira is teaching me, with his own way of life,
	that there is no end for the quest for perfect karate.</p>

<p>As an elder in the world of karate, Mr. Miyahira is in charge of
	the Okinawa Karate Conference and still gives his students lessons as
	well. In several symposiums held by the Karate Shinbun newspaper and
	the Ryukyu Shinpo newspaper, and also in his lectures, Mr. Miyahira has
	openly stated his own ideas about the future of Okinawa karate. Since
	those ideas are very suggestive, we will quote one of them here:</p>

<p>"During the World Uchinanchu Tournament, the Karate/Ancient Martial
	Arts Exchange Festival was a big success. This is a big step for a
	future full-scale world championship" (From the symposium "The Future
	Okinawa Karate", The Karate Shinbun: September, 1990 ).</p>

<p>When the karate lecture series for the general public took place
	for the first time (February~October, 1991), Master Katsuya Miyahira
	(President of the Okinawa Shorin Ryu Karate Association) taught the
	Shorin Ryu to about seventy people in one of the medium sized
	conference rooms of the Ryukyu Shinpo. Despite such a difficult theme
	as the lecture about karate, the seemingly small conference room was
	filled with eager karate fans and athletes. Master Miyahira explained
	to his audience the history of the Shorin Ryu and its characteristics
	by speaking about Choshin Chibana, his own master. The main difference
	between Mr. Miyahira's lecture and others' was that he mentioned
	Choshin Chibana's family tree in great detail. Choshin Chibana came
	from Suridennai and belonged to the high-rank warrior class. Out of his
	family line appeared many talented men who later became leaders of the
	society in different fields. One reason why Mr. Miyahira talked about
	the details of Chibana's life is to let his audience clearly understand
	the Shorin Ryu; another reason is probably based on his own unique
	philosophy for karate.</p>

<p>Mr. Miyahira often teaches the "virtue of martial arts" to young
	people. At the end of his lecture, he explained the value of karate,
	quoting the "Seven Virtues of Martial Arts" from one of the Chinese
	military strategy books. The quotation reads as follows:</p>

<p>"Martial arts forbids violence, suppresses an uprising, keeps one
	from corruption, establishes honor for one, pacifies the public, makes
	harmony among people, and makes one rich. These are the seven virtues
	of martial arts".</p>

<p>The martial arts (karate) can, according to Mr. Miyahira, be a
	helpful tool for one's life: it adds value to one's ability, secures a
	sure means of living, and even makes one rich. This interpretation may
	sound vulgar, but it shows that Mr. Miyahira focuses not only on the
	spirituality of karate, but also on its practicality. Even today, many
	karate experts tend to hold on to the volunteer spirit as their mottos,
	believing that one should not use karate as a tool for making a
	fortune, or as a means of living. This kind of Puritanism has been
	preventing Okinawa karate from flourishing in popularity and achieving
	economical success in dojo management.</p>

<p>The teaching of Itosu, however, does not insist on such
	Puritanism in karate; it seems to say that the more respectable a
	karate expert is, the more successful he should be socially and
	economically. Here we can see the will of Master Miyahira who, by
	having learned from Master Itosu, now instructs his students in
	accordance with his ideas: "Following the reason and the law" and
	"coexisting and co-flourishing".</p>

<p>Mr. Miyahira speaks about the Shorin Ryu as follows. In 1908, his
	teacher Anko Itosu submitted a petition to the prefectural officials of
	Okinawa to introduce karate into the regular public school curriculum.
	This petition of Itosu is called the "Ten Articles of Karate". Mr.
	Miyahira says that this is all one should know about the Shorin Ryu.
	Though it may be a little too long, we would like to present its
	contents here:</p>

<p>In the introduction, Itosu tells the history of karate ( China
	Hand ). It begins with the following sentences: "Karate came from
	neither Confucianism nor Buddhism. It started as the Classic Shorin Ryu
	and the Shorei Ryu, both of which came from China. Since these two
	methods have their merits and demerits, it is important to preserve and
	inherit them as they are". The paragraph continues as Itosu describes
	the purposes and training methods of karate, insisting that it be taken
	into the school education.</p>

<p>His first article says that though karate's aim is to strengthen
	one's body, the main reason for this is not to meet one's own needs,
	but to serve the society. Thus a karate athlete has to know that even
	if he were to be confronted with violence, he should never hurt his
	opponent.</p>

<p>The second article tells that karate strengthens bones and
	muscles of the body, making it as strong as iron and stone, so as to
	use the hands and feet in place of a spear or a sword. Itosu claims
	that such achievement is possible if one begins training his body when
	he is still in elementary school. Itosu then says that it would help
	Japan to build the society of soldiers, the ideal of Itosu's time when
	the whole nation was working hard to enrich and strengthen the country.</p>

<p>The third article explains that though one cannot be a karate
	expert in a short time, a mere one to two hours vigorous daily training
	would make one's physique incomparable to a normal person in three to
	four years. From that point on, many would continue pursuing the career
	of karate for life.</p>

<p>The fourth article claims that since the hands and feet are the
	most essential weapons in karate, one should train his by punching a
	makiwara every day. The point is to punch it one to two hundred times a
	day.</p>

<p>Itosu thus keeps explaining the essence of karate. His fifth
	article describes the correct positions; another points out the wrong
	training methods, warning, for example, that too much tension in
	muscles can harm the blood circulation. We can understand Mr.
	Miyahira's claim that this letter of Itosu alone works as the bible of
	the Shorin Ryu.</p>

<h3>Shorin Ryu</h3>

<p>Originally, there was no clear distinction among various schools
	of karate (ryu). The style developed and handed down from generation to
	generation in Shuri has been called the Shuri-te, the one in Naha the
	Naha-te, and the one in Tomari the Tomari-te. Shuri flourished as
	Okinawa's capital city for a long time. As the center of history,
	culture and politics, Shuri has produced many famous martial artists
	such as Kanga Sakugawa AKA Karate Sakugawa, Choken Makabe AKA Makabe
	Chansho, Sokon Matsumura AKA Warrior Matsumura, and Master Anko Itosu.
	Master Choshin Chibana learned one of the traditional ways of karate
	from Master Anko Itosu, who in turn had learned it from Master Sokon
	Matsumura. In 1933, Master Chibana named the said way of karate the
	Shorin Ryu in order to distinguish it from the Shuri-te's other ryus
	and thus became its founder.</p>

<p>The characteristics of the Shorin Ryu are detailed in the "Ten
	Articles of Karate", the petition submitted in 1908 by Master Anko
	Itosu, Master Choshin Chibana's teacher, to the education department of
	Okinawa Prefecture. The Shorin Ryu teaches stances and breathing
	methods that are natural and relaxed. It also teaches a unique method
	of taking in power and releasing it: one takes in power from inside
	outward. This method makes concentration of power easy, which, combined
	with the quickness of movement, increases the force of an attack. The
	basic training is the Naihanchi: one trains his hands mainly by
	punching a makiwara to increase the destroying force of an attack. Also
	when attacked, one should smash up the opponent as well as defend
	himself; this enables one to learn the technique of attack/defense
	combination.</p>

<p>In Okinawa Prefecture, there are currently 24 dojos that belong
	to the Okinawa Shorin Ryu Karate Association, for which Mr. Miyahira
	acts as the president. More branch dojos exist outside of Okinawa and
	abroad, as the popularity of the Shorin Ryu is increasing worldwide.</p>

<p>At the Bick Symposium Mr. Miyahira said: "It is important to
	develop the unique characteristics of each ryu of karate, but the most
	important thing today is to create an instruction plan that can be
	applied to any ryu. In order to achieve this, we have to educate our
	future instructors and found a karate university. It is possible to
	hold a world championship in three to five years. We should organize a
	task force to make the idea come true".</p>

<h2>Miyahira Katsuya (Shorinryu)</h2>

<p>The following are the teachings of Miyahira Katsuya, the present
	president of the Okinawa Shorin-ryu Karate-do Association and one of
	the senior most students of Chibana Choshin. Miyahira teaches in Naha,
	Okinawa, and has contributed a number of outstanding students to the
	shorin-ryu system. Miyahira Sensei began training with Chibana Sensei
	in 1933 and was promoted to 9-Dan Hanshi in 1967. Upon the death of his
	teacher, he formally received the HANKO (official seals of the
	organization) and was voted president of the Okinawa Shorinryu Karatedo
	Kyokai in March of 1969.</p>

<h3>Thoughts on Sparring</h3>

<p>I believe that free style sparring is essential to the advanced
	development of a student but only after the student's techniques are a
	part of their self. I must also state that the karate student's
	sparring techniques must come from the kata. This takes many years to
	develop and I do not allow a student to spar until they reach the
	sandan (third degree black belt) level. At this stage of their
	development, sparring can be helpful. Below the sandan level, free
	style sparring is too dangerous and will even hinder a student's
	development.</p>

<p>I teach my students to be concerned with the mastery of the
	traditional kata and unless they master the kata they can never hope to
	become proficient in the study of karate-do. When a student reaches a
	point in their development where they have a good understanding of the
	kata, I then introduce the techniques of semi-free sparring. These are
	prearranged techniques that test the student's ability to judge
	distances and application of blocks and counterattacks. Later we
	introduce a limited type of free style sparring where we limit the
	areas to be attacked.</p>

<h3>Thoughts on Correct Attitude</h3>

<p>Some modern-day teachers are trying to develop the karate
	attitude through methods of tournament competition. The old way has
	always been self-competition and self-study. One might become a good
	fighter but we cannot say that they are practicing budo karate. This
	type of individual is much too limited. A student's training must
	always be in balance.</p>

<h3>Thoughts on Kata</h3>

<p>Kata is never concrete in performance or interpretation. It
	changes either knowingly, unknowingly or through the passage of time.
	Sometime the changes are small -- like changing the emphasis of
	punching to kicking or to quick movements or to slow, steady movements.
	An instructor may favor one technique over another and tell his
	students to emphasize it more than it was originally taught. The kata
	is still the same but a change has now taken place either consciously
	or unconsciously. These minor changes have not really changed the
	style. These changes cannot be prevented either, for in most cases the
	change occurs over a long period of time.</p>

<h3>Thoughts on Karate Styles</h3>

<p>If you really look at the various names of the modern styles, it
	has no real meaning. Styles are based on the teachings of an
	individual. If the individual is good, then of course the style will be
	good. In the end, group styles are meaningless. You say that your style
	is better then this style or that style, let us see if you can prove
	it! A punch or kick can only be done in a limited number of ways that
	are combative. It is like a rifleman who shoots at a target. If he hits
	the target do you say that the rifle is a good shot or do you say that
	the man is a good shot? The rifle may be the most expensive and best
	rifle made but if the shooter is no good then the rifle will not hit
	the target. The rifle is the style and the shooter is the practitioner.</p>

<p>Miyahira Katsuya, Chibana Choshin's senior student, has no
	children. He has one brother who studied karate but he is a company
	president and has very little to do with karate. Miyahira still teaches
	Monday, Wednesday and Friday nights. He has always taught like that and
	has not changed his teaching times in over thirty years. On Okinawa,
	Miyahira is a recognized training partner of the great Motobu Choki.</p>

<p>Miyahira Katsuya has a habit of punching the tatami when bored,
	tired or nervous. This habit goes back to his childhood. In the 1930's
	Chibana took Miyahira to visit Itosu's granddaughter that still lived
	in the Itosu family home. They sat and talked at great lengths about
	the great Itosu. Finally, they started talking about the difficult
	times at the time of Itosu's death in 1915.</p>

<p>At this, Miyahira began to lose interest and unconsciously began
	to pound the tatami with his fist. The granddaughter immediately
	stopped her conversation with Chibana and looked at Miyahira. She then
	said, "That's a funny habit you have there. My grandfather use to do
	the same thing when he was bored!"</p>

<h3>The Toe-tipped Kick</h3>

<p>The two major styles of shorin-ryu (often referred to as Chibana
	style shorin-ryu and Matsubayashi-ryu) perform 85% of their front kicks
	(shomen geri) with what is called "tsumasaki geri" (toe-tipped kick).
	Of the kicks that are performed in basics and in kata, 85% are chudan
	shomen geri (middle area front kicks) and are done with the toe-tipped
	kick.</p>

<p>The other 15% are called jodan shomen geri (high front kicks) and
	are performed with the ball of the foot. The toe-tipped is usually not
	performed or practiced in Japan due to the difficulty of the kick. The
	Japanese prefer the ball of the foot kick and the instep kick due to
	the fact that they feel it is easier to "master." Nowadays, it is also
	rare to find an American Okinawan stylist who works on the toe-tipped
	kick. They, too, have sought to learn "the easier way."</p>

<p>Even today in Okinawa, the native practitioners still prefer the
	toe-tipped kick with the instep kick as a standby technique. Both of
	these kicks are diligently practiced on the makiwara and with training
	partners. The toe-tipped kick is performed straight in with the back
	and head straight. Tradition also indicates that when bringing the foot
	up for the kick, that it must be brought up to the opposite knee with
	the kicking foot pointed to a 90 degree angle forward (toward your
	opponent) before actually snapping the foot outward.</p>

<h3>Shorinryu Maxims</h3>

<p>The following also comes from the teachings of Miyahira Katsuya,
	Shorin-ryu Hanshi 10th Dan and president of the Okinawa Shorin-ryu
	Karate-do Kyokai. These maxims are written on the wall of his dojo and
	are a guide to help his students in a better understanding of the
	"Proper Spirit in Karate-do Training."</p>

<h3>Proper Spirit in Karatedo Training</h3>

<ol>
	<li>You should thoroughly understand and pay strict attention to
		your teacher's corrections and apply them correctly.</li>
	<li>You can attain perfection by exercising patience and through
		constant training.</li>
	<li>In learning the basic techniques, learn to apply them, adopt
		them and finally transform them to your own taste but always according
		to the correct theory of basic techniques.</li>
	<li>You should listen to and accept the corrections of the more
		senior or advanced students.</li>
	<li>Try to assimilate everything good in your peers and use it to
		correct that which is inconsistent in you.</li>
	<li>When teaching you should always be kind but firm and strict
		with your juniors.</li>
</ol>

<h3>Shorinryu Conduct</h3>

<p>The following is taken from the teachings of Miyahira Katsuya
	(Okinawa Shorin-ryu Karate-do Hanshi 10-Dan) and are found on display
	in his karate training hall located in Kokuba Naha, Okinawa:</p>

<h3>Proper Conduct in the Dojo</h3>

<ol>
	<li>To acquire experience and understanding, take seriously all
		advice given to you.</li>
	<li>Never judge or take a person lightly.</li>
	<li>Accept with an open mind the opinions and remarks of others,
		if they prove to be earnest, just and correct.</li>
	<li>Be honest, fair and true whenever you ponder over or reason
		out a problem or theory.</li>
	<li>When you are not training, quietly sit by the edge of the dojo
		and watch the activities of your fellow students and how they are
		corrected.</li>
</ol>
