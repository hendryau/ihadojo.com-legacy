<h2>Shinpan Gusukuma<br> <small>1890-1954</small></h2>

<p>One of Yasutsune "Ankoh" Itosu's students was Gusukuma Shinpan
	who was also a peer of Chibana Choshin. Gusukuma, also called Shinpan
	Shiroma by the Japanese, is virtually unknown due to the fact that he
	was a very quiet individual who was not interested in spreading the art
	that he so loved. His only concern was to teach good karate and hence
	only had a few dedicated students.</p>

<h3>Shorin-ryu Training In The 1950's</h3>

<p>Although a peer of Chibana Choshin, very little is said about the
	master technician, Gusukuma Shinpan. He began teaching shortly after
	WWII and was close friends with Miyagi Chojun, Kyoda Jyuhatsu and Kyan
	Chotoku. He taught regularly at Shuri Castle and had a dojo at his home
	in Nishihara City. He was a school teacher by profession but his first
	love was Shuri-style karate.</p>

<p>One of his former students was Iha Seikichi (who presently
	resides in East Lansing, Michigan) who often talks about his teacher.
	The following are some thoughts concerning how it was like to train in
	the l950's under Gusukuma:</p>

<p>Training under Gusukuma-sensei was very strict and traditional.
	It was a lot of self-training where he would watch to see how hard you
	wanted to learn. All students would first become an apprentice student
	and help clean the dojo for six months to a year. They could watch
	training but could not take part in receiving instructions.</p>

<p>When Gusukuma-sensei thought that they were ready, he would then
	tell them to join in. Sensei never actively taught but would have the
	senior students do all the teaching. Sensei would only teach the top
	two or three students and then have them pass on the knowledge. This
	was a very traditional way of teaching.</p>

<p>During class, sensei would evaluate every student and advise them
	of their weaknesses. He would allow each student to demonstrate two
	kata for him while he watched. Sensei would then tell them that they
	needed work on their stances, or their power, etc. They would then
	train themselves based on sensei's evaluation. Sensei would sometimes
	show a student a technique and then say, "Ha, I showed you something!
	You are very lucky I did this! Now go train!!!"</p>

<p>Gusukuma-sensei would personally teach the top two or three
	senior students and it was then their responsibility to pass on the
	methods to the rest of the students. One senior would always be there
	to teach while sensei observed or trained by himself. Sensei was about
	5'1" and weighed about 125 pounds. He was extremely strong and trained
	his fists and toes on the makiwara everyday. He believed a karate-man
	must be able to generate power equivalent to three times their own body
	weight with either fist or foot. Needless to say, the students were
	constantly repairing the makiwara punching boards.</p>
<p>If a student did not train hard, Gusukuma-sensei would tell him
	that he should leave and come back when he was ready to train. If the
	student continued with this attitude, Gusukuma-sensei would tell him
	not to come back unless he was serious about learning and training.
	Sensei was hardest on students that did not listen. He had a good
	memory and would often tell a student to work on his punch or kick or
	kata. If the student did not do this then sensei would bring it to
	their attention and kick him out of the dojo for wasting his time by
	not listening.</p>

<h3>Makiwara Training</h3>

<p>All styles of Okinawan karate-do stress the importance of the
	makiwara board. It is said that training with the makiwara develops
	power through concentration of technique. This ability to "focus" is
	external power developed internally. Through constant training with the
	makiwara the student starts developing confidence in their technique.
	They see that it is stronger than those that have just started and find
	that through this confidence they are really able to punch and kick
	harder.</p>
<p>This is the usual difference found in Okinawan karate as opposed
	to the others. Their focus is on power - and the power is extracted
	from the makiwara. A lot of people can look good punching the air but
	their power can be seen as lacking or in some cases, non-existent. So,
	through makiwara training, one can readily see the power generated by
	training with these ancient pieces of equipment.</p>
<p>Gusukuma Shinpan stressed and possessed great power for a man of
	his size (approximately five feet tall). He believed in being able to
	hit the makiwara with the equivalent of three times your own body
	weight. So, if one weighed approximately one hundred pounds, Gusukuma
	felt that this individual must be able to hit with approximately three
	hundred pounds of force.</p>
<p>Gusukuma strived to developed this kind of power with both hands
	and both feet. He kept this level of power through training with the
	makiwara board and striking it approximately 300 times per day with
	each weapon. He was a firm believer that a measure of a karate person
	was in their ability to produce this kind of power.</p>
<p>
<h3>Teaching Methods</h3>

<p>Gusukuma's teaching methods consisted of kata, kata and more
	kata. He believe that kata provided the foundation of the body and
	spirit. He said that the Japanese sword is sharp and beautiful but that
	in order to get to this end (that is, sharp and beautiful) it must be
	pounded and tempered with the sweat of one's body. So the teacher must
	do the same to the student. If the student is dedicated to the hard
	training of Okinawan karate, then he can be molded into something sharp
	and beautiful. After all, Okinawan karate-do, if done correctly, is
	"sharp and very beautiful" to watch. And like a sharp and beautiful
	Japanese sword, it is also very deadly.</p>

<h3>Techniques</h3>

<p>In the kata kusanku-dai, in the kick and the drop down technique,
	Gusukuma stood supreme. He could kick and travel about eight feet
	before he dropped down.</p>

<p>Gusukuma changed a number of Itosu's kata and techniques to
	coincide with his own personal "enlightenment." He stated that this is
	a common practice by all karatemen and that it is merely based on human
	nature to try and improve what one has learned. Gusukuma Shinpan had no
	fingernails because of his constant practice of the spear hand
	technique (nukite) on the bamboo bundles that he used as training aids.</p>

<h3>The Bus Driver</h3>

<p>In Okinawa, one of Gusukuma's students was a bus driver. One time
	a drunk got on board the bus and started to cause trouble with the
	passengers by trying to pick a fight. The student yelled at the drunk,
	"do you really want to fight?" The drunk was quick to take up the
	challenge and demanded to fight now. The student then said that he
	would be more than glad to show him his fighting prowess. At this the
	drunk became very angry and demanded that the driver open the door so
	that they could go at it. When the door opened the drunk stormed off
	and readied himself by taking off his coat. As the drunk got off, the
	student just simply smiled, quickly closed the door of the bus and
	drove off with the drunk in hot pursuit. After a several hundred feet
	run, the drunk fell and threw up on himself. The driver had nothing to
	prove to the drunk or to himself. All the passengers laughed and told
	the bus driver that he had used good strategy.</p>

<h3>Gusukuma's Family</h3>

<p>Gusukuma Shinpan has three sons and one daughter that are still
	alive today. During WWII he received a severe concussion from the
	American bombing that continued to bothered him for the rest of his
	life. He use to have severe headaches centered around the back of his
	right ear. The first son is presently a school teacher, the second son
	is handicapped from falling three stories on his back and his last son
	is presently a fireman. None of Gusukuma's sons have equalled their
	father in his karate skill but the first and the third son are strong
	enough to teach. None do.</p>

<h3>Dying</h3>

<p>Gusukuma Shinpan always told his students that he would refuse to
	become bedridden or get to a point where he could not take care of
	himself. On the day of his death, he taught class and trained for two
	hours. He ate a light dinner and went to bed early. Three hours later,
	when his wife checked in on him, they found that he had died in his
	sleep. That day his students stated that Gusukuma had spoken of his own
	death. He had said, "My body is strong but everyday my will gets even
	stronger. I will pick my day and die at peace with no long illness or
	discomfort for my family. Wait and see."</p>

<h3>Gusukuma The Teacher</h3>

<p>Gusukuma Shinpan was a school teacher and very educated while
	Chibana Choshin never finished high school. He saw the practice of
	karate as a hobby and never accepted payment for lessons. It should be
	noted that the common way of paying an instructor during the 1930s,
	1940s and 1950s was to bring food for all to share after training.</p>

<h3>Guskuma's Trip To Japan</h3>

<p>Just before the war and when Gusukuma Shinpan was in his prime he
	vacationed in Japan and saw a martial arts demonstration. He watched a
	group of female yari (spear) experts who had a dojo by his home in
	Tokyo. He was so impressed by their focus that he decided to take
	lessons in the yari from the female Sensei.</p>

<p>Gusukuma then went to her dojo and requested lessons. He also
	stated that he would only be in Japan for about three months because he
	was a high school teacher in Okinawa and that he had to return to
	teach. The teacher then gave him a wooden yari and showed him how to
	perform "nuki" (a spear thrust). He was then told to practice for about
	two or three hours.</p>
<p>Gusukuma continued to go to the dojo every day for three months
	and the only technique he practiced was the "nuki." Just before he
	returned to Okinawa, he asked the Sensei if he was doing well and
	whether he should practice other techniques. She replied that he was
	doing well but that he needed more practice before he could learn
	another technique. He then asked her what was the average time it took
	to go on to another technique. She replied, "about three years."</p>
<p>At the end of his stay in Japan, Gusukuma once again approached
	his Sensei to advise her he was returning to Okinawa. He thanked her
	for her time and stated that he would continue to practice and would be
	back next year.</p>
<p>She then took a long look at the great Gusukuma and said, "I'm
	glad that you'll continue to practice. We all need to do this in order
	to learn the WAY. Thank you for your efforts and good-bye." She then
	walked away.</p>

<h3>Gusukuma's Considerations</h3>

<p>Gusukuma Shinpan often spoke of the eight considerations in
	kicking and the four considerations of the punch.</p>

<h4>Considerations for kicking</h4>

<ol>
	<li>When kicking in kata or kumite, the back must be straight and
		true so as to allow you to punch if blocked.</li>
	<li>The quickest kicks are of the snapping variety.</li>
	<li>The kata kicks are performed with the toe-tipped foot.</li>
	<li>The most important kick is that done to the chudan (middle)
		area.</li>
	<li>Consider the knee the "hinge" of the kick.</li>
	<li>The ankle must be strong in kicking as the wrist is strong in
		punching.</li>
	<li>The leg is loose and flexible while the toes are tight. Just
		like a punch, the arm is loose while the fist is tight.</li>
	<li>When kicking, kick with both legs.</li>
</ol>

<h4>Considerations for punching</h4>

<ol>
	<li>The large knuckle finger and the thumb squeeze the index
		finger in a good fist.</li>
	<li>In making a strong fist, the index finger is folded first.</li>
	<li>Punching is done with a loose arm and tight fist.</li>
	<li>You strike with the index knuckle first.</li>
</ol>

<h3>Iha Sensei's Study with Gusukuma</h3>

<p>In 1950, Seikichi Iha was accepted to begin the formal study of
	karate with Shinpan Gusukuma (the kanji of his family name are also
	pronounced "Shiroma" in Japan), a student of Anko Itosu, at his dojo in
	Shuri City. Shinpan Gusukuma was well educated-working as a school
	teacher and also known for his skills as an acupuncturist. A student of
	Anko Itosu, Shinpan Gusukuma also studied under many other master
	teachers in different styles. He selected Shorin-ryu as his primary
	interest. Sensei Iha explains that in the past, Okinawan karate
	students might study with a variety of teachers. Someone would hear
	about a person who was good at a particular kata or technique and then
	go ask that person to teach him.</p>

<p>Iha notes that due to Gusukuma's schedule as a school
	teacher-teaching a few hours every day with summers off-he was able to
	concentrate on advancing his own practice of karate. A friend of Iha's
	encouraged him to begin karate with Gusukuma who, at that time, was in
	his 60's.</p>

<h3>Getting There</h3>

<p>Twice a week after work, Iha walked two hours from his home in
	Nishihara to the Gusukuma dojo. Iha often didn't have a chance to eat
	before leaving for class. He'd attend class and walk the two hours back
	home. Whenever possible, students would bring whatever food they had to
	share. In 1953, the year before he died, Gusukuma moved the dojo to
	Naha which was an even longer walking distance for Iha - all the way to
	the west coast of the island.</p>

<p>At this time in Okinawa, Sensei Iha explains, walking was just
	about the only way to get from place to place. Car travel was
	difficult-the roads were so narrow in places a driver would have to
	back out if someone came the other way. Even if a person had access to
	a car, gas wasn't easy to find. Any travel required a lot of planning
	so most people didn't go far from their homes-but there were many who
	dreamed about being able to travel the island in their lifetime.
	Gusukuma was one. Iha tells a story about when his teacher decided to
	walk to the northern tip of the island-a difficult task since there
	were few roads in that part of the island then. To do this, Sensei
	Gusukuma had to write out his itinerary for every day of walking,
	contact people and arrange where to send food in advance. Planning took
	a couple of years.</p>

<h3>The Gusukuma Dojo</h3>

<p>Iha remembers Sensei Gusukuma's dojo at Shuri as being a very
	small room. Only one student could demonstrate kata in front of him at
	a time. Students might often have to back up from the wall to complete
	a kata. There could be as many as 6 or 7 students in a class waiting
	for a turn to show their teacher the "homework" lessons they had been
	practicing. Gusukuma's later dojo in Naha was larger- a "three tatami"
	room (approx. 9' x 9').</p>

<h3>Strong Mind, Strong Body</h3>

<p>Gusukuma practiced Zen concentration and could maintain intense
	focus of his thoughts for long periods of time. He would often be
	completely absorbed in a game of Go (Chinese chess) when Iha arrived
	for class. Not wanting to disturb his teacher, Sensei Iha remembers
	practicing karate and leaving without Gusukuma breaking concentration
	on his game. His teacher asked him at the next class, "Why didn't you
	come to class last time?"</p>

<p>Iha describes Gusukuma as being extremely agile ("like an Olympic
	gymnast-he could do three spins from a bar hanging from his arms") and
	able to focus his punches so that 100 pounds of body weight could exert
	300 pounds of power. This power was achieved through daily training of
	hands and feet using the makiwara punching board. He would often say
	that if you see someone you think is skilled and want to be as good as
	them, watch how they practice. If they practice something 10 times, you
	must practice it 100 times. Iha recalls that Gusukuma's constant
	practice of spear hand techique (nukite) by striking bundles of bamboo
	had caused the nails to drop off all his fingers.</p>

<h3>Traditional Learning - One Step At a Time</h3>

<p>After each class, Sensei Iha recalls that he would go home and
	work on his karate homework for a couple days or more-returning to
	class only when he felt he could successfully demonstrate the lesson
	his teacher had given him. Sensei Gusukuma expected his students to
	intensively study and learn one thing at a time. Learning new material
	progressed slowly and methodically and required students to really
	learn and practice each new concept in great depth, then demonstrate
	their knowledge before moving on to the next lesson. One class might be
	only half of one pinan kata with the next class or more working on the
	same thing over and over again. (At this time in the Okinawan dojos,
	first year students might typically only learn Kihon Kata 1-3 and
	Naihanchi.)</p>

<p>The following story was related to Sensei Iha by Shinpan Gusukuma
	and Iha has retold it to his bo students to point out the importance of
	patience and practice. Shinpan Gusukuma went to Japan on his summer
	school teaching break. While there he wished to train in the naginata.
	He met with a teacher and explained what he wanted to learn. She showed
	him how to do the nuki (spear thrust) and told him to practice this
	technique 2 to 3 hours a day. Every day when he came to the teacher's
	dojo, she told him to practice the nuki technique, then she left. He
	practiced like this for his entire vacation. When it was time to return
	home, he asked his teacher how long it would take for the average
	student to learn the nuki and be able to go on to the next technique.
	She replied, "Oh, usually three years."</p>
